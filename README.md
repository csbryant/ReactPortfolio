This is a responsive portfolio of all of my coding work so far!

# Notes

Application created in react and deployed on Heroku.

Small Screen set to 640 px according to project asset photo size.

BONUS added- Created a sticky footer via bootstrap.

All photos are personal photos to be used for this homework project only - Photos in Portfolio are placeholders for projects to hopefully be added in the future.

A few CSS elements added for personal taste:

Animated Gradient background.

Bootstrap submit button in contact over-ruled to be pink in CSS.

Created my own cards for the portfolio section.

Icons for social media in contact with spinning animations.
